# Data Preprocessing with Keras Data API and scikit-learn

This repository provides examples and code snippets for data preprocessing using the Keras Data API and scikit-learn.

## Overview

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline, as it involves transforming raw data into a format suitable for training machine learning models. The Keras Data API offers powerful tools for loading and manipulating data within the TensorFlow ecosystem, while scikit-learn provides a wide range of traditional preprocessing techniques.
